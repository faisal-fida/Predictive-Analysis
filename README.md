# Predictive Analysis

This repository contains a set of scripts, notebooks, and data files for building and evaluating predictive models. The primary goal is to showcase different modeling techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preparation steps
- Multiple machine learning models for comparison
- Model performance metrics and evaluation techniques
- Example notebooks demonstrating usage and best practices

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faisal-fida/Predictive-Analysis.git
   cd Predictive-Analysis
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the packages listed in the requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Example Notebooks**  
   Launch the notebooks (e.g., with Jupyter or VS Code) to explore and execute the code:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Customize the dataset or configuration in the notebooks or scripts.
- Run the training and evaluation scripts to generate models and view performance results.
